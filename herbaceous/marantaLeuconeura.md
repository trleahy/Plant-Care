## Prayer Plant Care
Prayer plants are low-growing, spreading plants that thrive best when provided with greenhouse-like conditions, including warm, moist, gentle airflow, and plenty of fertiliser. Poorly drained soil can cause the plant to die from root rot or collapse. Likewise, plants that are exposed to too much sun can become washed out and develop brown blotches on their leaves.

### Light
Hang or set your prayer plant near a window where it will receive indirect sunlight. Never set your plant in direct sunlight because the sun will scorch the plant’s leaves or the leaves will develop blotches or patches and fade in colour intensity. Prayer plants are generally tolerant of lower light areas. In the winter, when the plants go into dormancy (and sometimes die back completely), provide them with bright light to maintain growth.

### Soil
Prayer plants can prosper in a variety of soils, as long as they're well-draining. Typically, a traditional potting mix works fine, but you can make your own by combining two parts sphagnum peat moss, one part loamy soil, and one part perlite or coarse sand together. In addition, the soil should be acidic, with a pH of 6.0. To improve drainage, add rocks or gravel to the bottom of your pot and be sure that the pot has ample drainage holes.

### Water
During their growing season, water your prayer plant frequently (whenever the top layer becomes dry) and never allow the potting soil to dry out completely. These plants are very susceptible to drought and will not survive long if left unwatered. However, to avoid fungal problems, do not let water sit directly on the leaves or let the plant get soggy. Both insufficient water and overwatering your plant can cause the leaves to turn yellow and drop. When watering your prayer plant, use water that is at least at room temperature, if not slightly warm.

### Temperature and Humidity
Prayer plants prefer normal household temperatures between 60 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Prolonged lower temperatures can damage the leaves and cause them to drop from the plant. Additionally, prayer plants thrive best in a very humid environment. To increase the humidity available to your plant, you can place a small humidifier nearby, or place the plant atop a tray that has been filled with small stones and water. You can also mist the leaves frequently with room temperature or slightly warm water.

### Fertilizer
Fertilize your prayer plant every two weeks from early spring through fall (reducing to once a month in winter) with a water-soluble houseplant fertilizer diluted to half-strength. If you use too little fertilizer, your plant will grow slowly or hardly at all. However, too much fertilizer can burn the plant's roots—its leaves will start to brown and the plant can even die.

## Types of Prayer Plants
There are many varieties of prayer plants, but the most popular by far is the tricolor variation available at many garden centers. Prayer plants and calathea plants are so closely associated with one another that it's not uncommon for them to be mislabeled. Within the Maranta genus, a few species are the most common:
* **M. leuconeura erythrophylla**: This tri-colored prayer plant, also called the herringbone plant, is the most common variety and features bold red veins.
* **M. leuconeura kerchoveana**: This variety, also known as Rabbit's Tracks, has plain green leaves with two rows of darker splotches.
* **M. leuconeura massangeana**: This variety has a darker leaf background with silvery blotches along the midrib and white leaf veins.

## Pruning
If you want to make your prayer plant bushy, prune it. Use a sterilized pair of garden scissors and clip the stems right above a leaf node. The prayer plant will respond by sending out new shoots directly below the cut area, making for a bushier appearance! Do this 2 to 3 times per year in fall and early spring before your plants’ growth season. Remove any diseased parts as they crop up.

## Propagating Prayer Plants
Propagating prayer plants is a surprisingly easy way to increase your collection and make use of larger mother plants. The most common (and easiest) way to propagate prayer plants is to divide the plant while repotting. Here's how:
1. When repotting your prayer plant, divide it into several smaller plants by gently shaking the soil off the roots and working them apart.
2. Ensure each new plant has a good mass of roots and several stems.
3. Pot these new smaller plants separately into shallow pots.
4. Keep new divisions very warm and moist during the first few weeks until new growth emerges.

## Potting and Repotting Swiss Cheese Plant
You won’t need to re-pot your prayer plant much at all. However, when it becomes root-bound, it will grow much slower. To re-pot, choose a container that is 1 to 2 inches wider than the existing pot. Remove your prayer plant from the current pot and put it in the new pot with a bit of extra soil mix. Water well and your prayer plant will grow easily.

## Common Pests & Plant Diseases
- Leaf spot is a fungal disease that can affect prayer plants in overly wet conditions. Water soaked lesions are a sign this disease has set in. If this occurs, move your prayer plant away from other plants to prevent the spread of this disease. Neem will kill an existing infection. Reduce watering and misting to prevent further infection.  
- Root rot is another disease caused by fungi that love temperate and wet conditions. Mushy stems and leaves are an indication your plant is experiencing rot. Reduce watering and misting to prevent the rot from spreading througout the plant. Remove any damaged leaves or stems. If the problem persists even after this, you may have to start over with a new plant.
- Spider mites, aphids, and thrips suck the sap from prayer plants, causing lesions and limiting nutrient availability to your plant. If you see webs that these mites weave, or the prayer plant leaves curling, use neem oil to get rid of these congregating insects.
- Fungus gnats are more common indoors than out. While the adult form of these pests don’t harm your prayer plant, they can lay eggs that hatch root-hungry larvae. You can dilute neem in water, and irrigate your plants with it every week or so to kill any eggs or larvae.
- Mealybugs are tiny cotton ball bugs that suck plant sap. To get rid of them, pop them off your plant with a q-tip soaked in rubbing alcohol. Then mist your plant with insecticidal soap to prevent any further infections.

## Common Problems With Prayer Plants
{: .no_toc }
Like many other houseplants, prayer plants can be prone to spider mites and mealybugs.1 If you notice signs of infestation, such as a white powdery substance on the leaves or browning of the foliage, you can treat your plant with a natural insecticide such as neem oil.

### Leaves Turning Yellow
Yellowing of the leaves is commonly the result of overwatering. Make sure your plant is never sitting in soggy soil, and allow it to slightly dry out between waterings.

### Drooping and Wilting Leaves
If the leaves of a Prayer Plant appear droopy, it could be one of many things! Some plant parents experienced droopy leaves because they were using tap water (some plants are sensitive to the microamounts of fluoride we have in our tap water) and they fixed it by filtering the water before feeding it to the plant. Other plant parents were able to fix droopy leaves on their pray plant by bottom watering, instead of watering from the top.

## FAQ
* **Are Prayer Plants easy to care for?**<br>
Prayer plants are relatively easy to care for, though they prefer greenhouse-like conditions, which may be hard to achieve indoors in some areas.
* **How fast do prayer plants grow?**<br>
Prayer plants are considered slow growers and generally reach about 12 inches at their tallest.
* **Can prayer plants grow indoors?**<br>
Yes—in fact, prayer plants will often grow most successfully indoors. They require very tropical conditions which can be hard to achieve outdoors in many parts of the country.
