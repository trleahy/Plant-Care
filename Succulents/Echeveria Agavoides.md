## Wax Agave Care
Hailing from the rocky, arid regions of Mexico, the Echeveria Agavoides Lipstick is a real beauty, adorned not only with stunning foliage but also with pink to red bell-shaped flowers. This succulent queen may look fragile, but it is, in fact, a tenacious plant. Although succulents do not need a lot of attention and upkeep, it is still very important to provide the plant with a nurturing environment that caters to its growth requirements.

### Light
Echeveria Agavoides Lipstick loves to bask in bright, indirect light. It can tolerate direct sunlight and the red color of the leaves is developed with lots of bright, direct light, but intense scorching sun can cause the leaves to burn. If you plant this succulent outdoors, it should be in a safe spot away from the harsh afternoon sun. Echeveria succulents need at least 6 hours of lighting daily, so you should place it in a lit, sunny spot indoors and consider investing in a grow light during the dark winter months. 

### Soil
As a succulent, Echeveria Agavoides Lipstick plants prefer well-draining soils. A mixture of cactus soil and perlite or sand works well for this plant. When potting your plant, make sure to use a pot with drainage holes to allow excess water to escape. Do not use rich soil that locks in the moisture, as it would lead to root rot and overwatering issues. This plant thrives well in rocky, sunny gardens.

### Water
Like most succulent plants, Echeveria Agavoides Lipstick plants prefer infrequent but deep watering. It's important to allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, as overwatering can lead to root rot and other problems. To water your plant, simply give it a good soak, making sure that the water reaches the roots. After watering, allow the soil to drain completely before placing the plant back in its spot. To check if your succulent is ready for watering, stick your finger about two inches into the soil. If your finger comes out dry, it’s time to give your plant a drink.

### Temperature and Humidity
Echeveria Agavoides Lipstick plants prefer warm temperatures, ideally between 60 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit, and low to medium humidity (30-40%). High humidity is a breeding ground for mold, pests, and root rot in succulents, so avoid placing your plant in a humid place like a bathroom or kitchen. Echeverias can tolerate slightly cooler temperatures but should be kept away from drafts and cold windows. In the winter months, it's important to protect your plant from frost. This succulent can be grown outdoors in USDA Hardiness zone 9a-11b.

### Fertilizer
Echeveria Agavoides Lipstick plants do not require much fertilizer, but a light feeding of a balanced fertilizer in the spring and summer can help promote healthy growth. Make sure to dilute the fertilizer according to the manufacturer's instructions, and only fertilize your plant when it is actively growing.

## Types of Wax Agave
There are several species that bear the name of the Swiss cheese plant, including:
* **Prolifera**: Also called Carpet Echeveria, this succulent has full and tight rosettes. Its leaves are bright green with tips so light they’re more pink than red. Prolifera grows offsets much more willingly than other agavoides, enabling it to spread out over time.
* **Maria**: The green and red contrast boldly and beautifully in this form. The red tips often end up rimming the entire top half of each leaf. This bright color also extends slightly down the leaf’s spine. The rosette of this form is larger than the basic agavoides; it grows up to 14 inches wide.
* **Lipstick**: The lime green leaves of this plant indeed look like they’ve been lined in lipstick. Dark red rims the edges, adding a delicate touch to the whole rosette.
* **Ebony**: While not black as the name implies, this is definitely a darker form of wax Echeveria. The leaves are greyish green, giving the succulent a shadowy look. Instead of just tips, the whole edge of each leaf is bright red. This coloring gets darker towards the center of the rosette.
* **Aquamarine**: This form is only red on the very tips of the blue-green leaves. The rosette is extra chunky, giving this succulent some cute personality.

## Pruning
This rosette succulent does not need regular pruning, but you can cut off dead or damaged leaves, or leaves growing out of shape with a sharp, clean pair of scissors or a knife. You can also remove offsets to make space for the mother plant. Leaf cuttings and offsets can be used for propagation.

## Propagating Wax Agave
Echeveria Agavoides Lipstick can be propagated with offsets or leaf cuttings. Follow these simple steps:
1. Gently twist to remove offsets and healthy leaves for propagation. You can also use a clean, sharp pair of scissors or a knife.
2. Let the cuttings or offsets callous over for a couple of days before dipping the bottom tips on a rooting hormone and plant into well-draining soil.
3. Mist the soil frequently to keep it moist. Place the cuttings or offsets in a bright, airy spot away from direct sunlight.
4. When roots begin to form and new plants develop, you can repot them in separate pots.

## Potting and Repotting Wax Agave
Like all succulents, Echeveria Agavoides Lipstick requires well-drained soil with optimum drainage. You should pick a pot made from porous materials like concrete, ceramic, or terracotta with at least one drainage hole. Echeveria Lipstick is a slow grower and does not require frequent repotting. This succulent should be repotted every 2-3 years with a pot only one size larger during the growing season (spring-summer). You should water it thoroughly a couple of days before repotting, so the leaves can take in as much water as it needed. Inspect the roots for any sign of root rot and root balls before repotting in new, clean soil. Do not water for 1-2 weeks after the repot so the roots have time to adjust to the new soil.

## Common Pests & Plant Diseases
Aphids are small, colorful, and hungry for succulent sap. Keep them away by ensuring your Wax Echeveria is dry. You can also apply diatomaceous earth to the soil and neem oil to the leaves. If you notice some aphids hanging out on your plant, use an insecticidal soap to eradicate them. Mealybugs are most likely to show up if there are dead leaves lying on the soil. What starts as a good hiding spot turns into a permanent home for these pests. Keep them away by removing debris and preventing excess moisture.

## Common Problems With Wax Agave
{: .no_toc }
While the Echeveria Agavoides Lipstick is a fairly low-maintenance and easy-care succulent, it can still experience a few problems and issues that gardeners and plant enthusiasts should be aware of.

### Leaves Turning Yellow
As with most succulents, overwatering can lead to root rot and other issues. Signs of overwatering include yellowing leaves, mushy stems, and a general lack of vitality.

### Pest Infestations
Echeveria Agavoides Lipstick plants can be affected by spider mites, mealybugs, and other insects, especially if planted outdoors. Inspect the plant regularly for signs of pests, such as webbing or white cottony growths, and treat them with an insecticidal solution according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

### Sunburn
While this plant can tolerate direct sun, too much and too intense direct sunlight can cause the leaves to become scorched and discolored. Move your plant to a shady location or use a sheer curtain to filter the sunlight.

## FAQ
* **Why do my plant's leaves turn yellow and wither?**<br>
It's a natural phenomenon for leaves turn yellow and wither. Don't panic. If new buds turn yellow and withered, it is abnormal, and may be caused by lack of some mineral fertilizer or by sunburn.
* **Why do its leaves wrinkle?**<br>
Wrinkled leaves are generally due to water shortage. When a succulent lacks water, wrinkled or shriveled leaves reminds you to water them.
* **Why does it have a very tall stem but few leaves?**<br>
Lack of light can lead to a weak, tall stem, fewer leaves, and vulnerableness of plant tissue, which makes the plant prone to injury. Place the succulent in a well-lit area and it will slowly improve over time.
