# Perennials

Popular, diverse and versatile, perennials fill our gardens with colour and interest in every season, and there’s a huge range of easy-to-grow, free-flowering options to choose from.
They’re available in many shapes and sizes, with flowers in every colour imaginable, and when planted in borders or containers they can perform for many years.
