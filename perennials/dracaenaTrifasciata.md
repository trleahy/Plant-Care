## Snake Plant Care
Snake plant is a good choice for beginners due to it's broad tolerance of growing conditions. It's an ideal container plant that adds vertical structure and interest as a decorative indoor plant. Snake plant thrives in warm weather and is drought-resistant, but it is susceptible to overwatering and struggles in cold environments. Only water the plant when soil feels dry. These plants can go two months between watering in winter months. In warmer months, water no more than every two weeks.

### Light
Snake plants prefer warm, bright light and grow well with eight to ten hours of indirect sunlight or a few hours of early morning direct sunlight. Too much direct sunlight causes leaves to become limp and can burn the plant. They tolerate shade but inadequate light slows photosynthesis, stunts growth, and dilutes color in the leaves. To keep your snake plant robust and healthy make sure it receives some sunlight daily.

### Soil
As a houseplant, snake plants prefer a loose, well-drained potting soil mix. They do well in sandier soil which makes all-purpose cactus potting soil a good choice. Avoid soil mixes that contain a high percentage of peat, which can retain too much water.

### Water
Water your snake plant when soil becomes almost completely dry, then water thoroughly. Check soil mix every two weeks for moisture during winter. Your plant might need hydration only once a month. If leaves become brittle and dry, water immediately. Once every two weeks during the growing season in spring and summer is usually sufficient, but keep in mind overwatering is the quickest way to kill a snake plant. Too much water or allowing the plant to sit in water rots the shallow root system. Yellowing leaves are an early sign your plant might be waterlogged.

### Temperature and Humidity
Snake plants grow best in warm temperatures between 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Keep plants out of drafts. They won't tolerate frost and prolonged exposure to less than 50 degrees Fahrenheit will eventually lead to its demise. Average household humidity between 30 and 50 percent is adequate.

### Fertilizer
Feed once in spring and mid-summer with a balanced, slow-release 10-10-10 fertilizer diluted to half strength. Do not fertilize in winter.

## Types of Prayer Plants
There are many varieties of prayer plants, but the most popular by far is the tricolor variation available at many garden centers. Prayer plants and calathea plants are so closely associated with one another that it's not uncommon for them to be mislabeled. Within the Maranta genus, a few species are the most common:
* **Dracaena trifasciata ***Hahnii*****: Also called bird's nest snake plant, 'Hahnii" grows to just six inches tall.
* **Dracaena angolensi**: This cylindrical snake plant has round, stiff leaves several feet long. arching outward from a central crown.
* **Dracaena trifasciata ***Laurentii*****: This variegated cultivar has creamy yellow leaf margins.
* **Dracaena trifasciata ***Twisted Sister*****: Twisting leaves bear horizontal stripes with yellow variegated edges. It grows to 15 inches tall.
* **Dracaena trifasciata ***Bantel’s Sensation*****: Leaves are narrow with white vertical stripes on this three-foot tall variety.
* **Dracaena pearsonii**: Sometimes called rhino grass, this plant features succulent red-tinted leaves and grows to 12 inches tall.

## Pruning
Prune snake plant during the growing season to encourage new growth. To control height, remove the tallest leaves at the soil line with a sterile cutting tool. Damaged leaves can be removed any time, however winter pruning can cause stress.

## Propagating Prayer Plants
Snake plant is propagated in spring or summer by cuttings or division when plants are at least four inches tall. New shoots that emerge can also be potted independently. Follow these instructions for both methods.

### Propagate via root division
1. Gather a sharp clean knife, a clean pot, and potting soil that is designed for growing cacti and succulents.
2. Remove the plant from the pot and place it on a flat surface. Brush soil from the root structure or rhizome.
3. Use the knife to divide the plant into sections, keeping roots for each section intact.
4. Replant sections into clean pots filled with the potting soil.
5. Water and place in a partly sunny location.
Offshoots or pups are baby plants emerging from soil. Follow directions for root division to remove pups and replant each in its own pot.

### Propagate from leaf-cuttings
1. Use a sterile cutting tool to remove a long, healthy leaf at its base.
2. Submerge the cut end of the leaf in a clean jar of water and set the jar in a partly sunny location. Or allow the cut end to callous over for 24 hours and then pot it cut-end down.
3. When using the water rooting method, refresh water every two weeks.
4. Roots develop in one to four months. Once they reach one inch long, plant the cutting in cactus potting mix.
5. Water and place in a partially sunny spot.

## Potting and Repotting Swiss Cheese Plant
Snake plants prefer wide shallow pots with plenty of drainage holes. The container diameter should be roughly twice the size of the root ball. When potting a snake plant, place it at the same level as it was in the original pot. Strong roots can crack and break plastic pots so choose a sturdy pot of ceramic, terra cotta, or clay. It's time to repot again into a container two inches wider when roots become overcrowded or the plant outgrows its original pot. The best time to repot is in spring.

## Common Pests & Plant Diseases
Snake plants are susceptible to common houseplant pests such as scales, gnats, spider mites, aphids, mealybugs, and whiteflies. Most can be removed by hand or a gentle spray of water. Treat infestations with neem oil.

## Common Problems With Prayer Plants
{: .no_toc }
Snake plants are one of the easiest plants to maintain and last for many years. Most problems are caused by overwatering which can lead to fungal infections and root rot.

### Foul-smelling Soil
When soil develops a foul odor, the plant likely has root rot.3 Remove the plant from its pot and inspect the roots to determine if it can be saved. Cut away any brown, mushy roots and leaves, then repot the healthy portion of the rhizome.

### Yellow or Brown Leaves
Healthy snake plant leaves are green with cream, yellow, or white edges. Yellow or brown leaves indicate overwatering, pests, or root rot. Avoid these conditions by maintaining a proper watering schedule only when soil is dry.

### Curling Leaves
Thrips are a common pest that cause curling leaves.4 Cut away severely affected leaves and spray the plant with neem oil to keep these tiny pests at bay.

### Leaves Falling Over or Drooping
Healthy snake plant leaves grow upward and stand erect, but too much water, insufficient light, or poor potting material can cause leaves to droop or flop over. Move the plant to a brighter location, reduce watering frequency, and replace soil with a mix that drains better.

## FAQ
* **Are Snake Plants easy to care for?**<br>
Snake plants are one of the easiest houseplants to keep and need very little maintenance once you find the perfect spot for them with lots of indirect sunlight. However, overwatering is the quickest way to kill it, so water this plant only when soil is dry.
* **How fast do Snake lants grow?**<br>
Snake plant is a slow grower. Seasonal change spurs development, so placing plants in a shade or partial shade location outdoors in summer often boosts growth.
* **How long does a snake plant live?**<br>
The average lifespan of a snake plant is five to ten years; however, they can live up to 25 years or more.

* **What's the difference between Nassauvia serpens and Dracaena trifasciata?**<br>
Although Nassauvia serpens and Dracaena trifasciata are both called snake plant, the two are unrelated. Nassauvia serpens is a perennial shrub in the aster family native to the Falkland Islands.
